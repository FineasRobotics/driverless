# YOLO ROS: Real-Time Object Detection for ROS

![Darknet Ros example: Detection image](darknet_ros/doc/test_detection.png)

## Installation

### Dependencies

This software is built on the Robotic Operating System ([ROS]), which needs to be [installed](http://wiki.ros.org) first. Additionally, YOLO for ROS depends on following software:

- [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) (computer vision library),
- [boost](http://www.boost.org/) (c++ library),

### Building

To maximize performance, make sure to build in *Release* mode. You can specify the build type by setting

    catkin_make -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

### Download weights

The yolo-voc.weights and tiny-yolo-voc.weights are downloaded automatically in the CMakeLists.txt file. If you need to download them again, go into the weights folder and download the two pre-trained weights from the COCO data set:

    cd your_workspace/src/darknet_ros/darknet_ros/yolo_network_config/weights/
    wget http://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov2.weights
    wget http://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov2-tiny.weights

And weights from the VOC data set can be found here:

    wget http://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov2-voc.weights
    wget http://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov2-tiny-voc.weights

And the pre-trained weight from YOLO v3 can be found here:

    wget http://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3-voc.weights
    wget http://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights

### Use your own detection objects

In order to use your own detection objects you need to provide your weights and your cfg file inside the directories:

    your_workspace/src/darknet_ros/darknet_ros/yolo_network_config/weights/
    your_workspace/src/darknet_ros/darknet_ros/yolo_network_config/cfg/

In addition, you need to create your config file for ROS where you define the names of the detection objects. You need to include it inside:

    your_workspace/src/darknet_ros/darknet_ros/config/

Then in the launch file you have to point to your new config file in the line:

    <rosparam command="load" ns="darknet_ros" file="$(find darknet_ros)/config/your_config_file.yaml"/>
